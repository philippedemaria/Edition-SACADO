\textbf{Les savoir-faire du parcours}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Utiliser des nombres pour calculer et résoudre des problèmes}
\item[$\square$] \textbf{Chercher :}  Tester, essayer plusieurs pistes de résolution.
\item[$\square$] \textbf{Représenter :} Produire et utiliser plusieurs représentations des nombres.
\item[$\square$] \textbf{Raisonner :} Mener collectivement une investigation en sachant prendre en compte le point de vue d’autrui.
\item[$\square$] \textbf{Communiquer :} Expliquer à l’oral ou à l’écrit (sa démarche, son raisonnement, un calcul, un protocole de construction géométrique, un algorithme), comprendre les explications d’un autre
et argumenter dans l’échange.

\begin{enumerate}
\item On considère le nombre $\frac{19}{11}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Donner le développement décimal de $\frac{19}{11}$ avec 8 chiffres significatifs. $\frac{19}{11}$ semble-t-il décimal ?
\item On dit que $\frac{19}{11}$ a une écriture périodique.
Préciser sa période (série de chiffres qui se répète à l'infini dans le développement décimal).
\end{enumerate}
\item On considère le nombre $x=0,13131313....$ dont le développement décimal a pour période 13.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Démontrer que $100x = 13 + x$. 
\item  En déduire une écriture fractionnaire de $x$. Quelle est la nature du nombre $x$ ?
\end{enumerate}
\item Démontrer que $x=3,412412412...$ est un nombre rationnel. 
\item Estimer le résultat avec la calculatrice.
